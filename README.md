Hi there 👋 I am Brandon Sosa, PhD candidate in the [Tropical Fish Ecology Lab](https://www.tropicalfishecologylab.com/) @ FIU (he/him)

My research focuses on grazer stocking to support coral reef restoration, exploring how invertebrate grazers like urchins and crabs can help control algal overgrowth and enhance reef recovery.


🔬 **What I Work On**

🦀 Grazer Stocking & Mariculture – Studying aquaculture and grow-out methods to scale up marine grazer production for reef restoration.

📊 Ecological & Socioeconomic Modeling – Using simulations and valuation studies to inform restoration decisions.

🌊 Social Surveys & Stakeholder Engagement – Understanding public perceptions and management considerations for large-scale grazer stocking.
